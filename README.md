# The SUIT Canvas Toolkit

What does it mean? SUIT stands for "slick user-interface toolkit". It is meant to be a easy-to-use, beautiful, modular, and fully-featured UI toolkit for the HTML5 canvas.

The project is nowhere near being fully-featured, but work is continuing at a very rapid pace. A lot of the code is ported from or inspired by the [SUIT Midlet Toolkit](https://code.google.com/p/suit-midlet-toolkit/) and the [GTK+ Toolkit](http://www.gtk.org/).
